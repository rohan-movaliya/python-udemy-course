Using what you have learnt about HTTP request and REST APIs, in today's project you will build a website that uses data from a public API.

For example, previously we create a rain alert app using a weather API. We also created an ISS tracker and looking into Bitcoin prices, all using a public API.

Today, you get to work on an API that you find interesting and build a service or website based on that API.

Here are some example APIs:

New York Subway Data

Elephant Data

Barcode Generator/Recognition

Stock Market Data

Harry Potter Data

Art Data

Dictionary API

ESPN Data

Food Facts API

Brewery Data

Spelling and Grammar Check API

Sound Effects API

Lord of the Rings API
